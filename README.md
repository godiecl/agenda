## Description

A phonebook application written in Java is a software tool that manages contact information, such as names, phone
numbers, and addresses. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and deleting contact details. The
application utilizes Java's object-oriented programming capabilities to organize data efficiently. It often features
search functionality to quickly locate contact information. Persistence mechanisms like file I/O or database
connectivity are implemented to save the contacts permanently.

## Tools

- **Language**: [Java 17](https://jdk.java.net/): Java is the #1 programming language and development platform. It
  reduces costs, shortens development timeframes, drives innovation, and improves application services.
- **Libraries**:
    - [Google Gson](https://github.com/google/gson): Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects
      into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.
    - [FlatLaf](https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf): FlatLaf is a modern open-source cross-platform Look and Feel
      for Java Swing desktop applications.
